				<p class="border4">My name is Ramazan. I am 18 years old. I was born on October 15, 2004 in the city of Taraz, Zhambyl region, Kazakhstan. I am a first-year student in cybersecurity at Astana IT University. I graduated from a specialized school for gifted children with education in three languages in the city of Taraz. I was an excellent student and received a red certificate. When I was at school, I took part in various olympiads. I have achievements as the winner of a prize in the Presidential Olympiad, the winner of a prize in the Republican and International Olympiad for the protection of the project. I like to spend my free time on music. I listen and play songs on the guitar. In addition to the guitar, I play the dombra and perform Kazakh national kuyi. I also want to learn how to play the piano.</p>
				<p class="border4">I had a choice to enter the University of Astana or the University of Almaty. Of course, like all young people, I wanted to enter Almaty. But I changed my mind. Almaty is a beautiful city where you can walk, have fun and work in parallel with your studies, but I think Astana is the city of the future. When I first came to this city, I was shocked by the beauty of the big building. There are a lot of people in Almaty and the streets are cramped, but here the streets are made as if for kings. The architecture of the city is very beautiful. I now understand that I made the right choice. In the future, I want to stay in this city and grow in my career here</p>
